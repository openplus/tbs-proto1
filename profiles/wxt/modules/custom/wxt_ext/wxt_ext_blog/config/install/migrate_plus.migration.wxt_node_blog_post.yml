        <p>Open data is data that can be freely used, shared and built-on by
        anyone, anywhere, for any purpose. This is the summary of the full Open
        Definition which the Open Knowledge Foundation created in 2005 to
        provide both a succinct explanation and a detailed definition of open
        data.</p>

        <p>As the open data movement grows, and even more governments and
        organisations sign up to open data, it becomes ever more important that
        there is a clear and agreed definition for what “open data” means if we
        are to realise the full benefits of openness, and avoid the risks of
        creating incompatibility between projects and splintering the
        community.</p>

        <p>Open can apply to information from any source and about any topic.
        Anyone can release their data under an open licence for free use by and
        benefit to the public. Although we may think mostly about government
        and public sector bodies releasing public information such as budgets
        or maps, or researchers sharing their results data and publications,
        any organisation can open information (corporations, universities,
        NGOs, startups, charities, community groups and individuals).</p>

        <p>Open data gains additional economic value when governments support
        open data initiatives, although increased uptake and citizen engagement
        is vital to the economic success of open data. Greater economic impact
        depends on revenue growth, cost reduction, and job creation. Revenue
        can be increased through the use of open data with the creation of new
        businesses, new good or services, or improved goods and services.</p>

        When businesses profit from the creation of goods or services that rely
        upon open data not only does their company reap the financial benefits
        but the government does as well, through the increase of tax revenue.
        Cost reduction helps to increase revenue for private sector businesses
        but is also an asset to government. Cost reduction in government,
        whether through reduction of services required or labor requirements,
        reduces government spending in some areas allowing for investment in
        others. Open data can also increase economic benefit through the
        creation of jobs. Jobs can be created through innovative
        entrepreneurship or through the requirement of skilled labourers to use
        and understand data.</p>

        <p>There are a range of different arguments for open government data.
        For example, some advocates contend that making government information
        available to the public as machine readable open data can facilitate
        government transparency, accountability and public participation. Some
        make the case that opening up official information can support
        technological innovation and economic growth by enabling third parties
        to develop new kinds of digital applications and services.</p>

        <p>Several national governments have created web sites to distribute a
        portion of the data they collect. It is a concept for a collaborative
        project in municipal Government to create and organize Culture for Open
        Data or Open government data.</p>

      body: |
        <p>The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally
        established with the formation of the World Data Center system, in
        preparation for the International Geophysical Year of 1957–1958. The
        International Council of Scientific Unions (now the International
        Council for Science) established several World Data Centers to minimize
        the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility, further
        recommending in 1955 that data be made available in machine-readable
        form.</p>

        <p>While the open-science-data movement long predates the Internet, the
        availability of fast, ubiquitous networking has significantly changed
        the context of Open science data, since publishing or obtaining data
        has become much less expensive and time-consuming.</p>

        <p>The Human Genome Project was a major initiative that exemplified the
        power of open data. It was built upon the so-called Bermuda Principles,
        stipulating that: "All human genomic sequence information (…) should
        be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage
        research and development and to maximise its benefit to society'.
        More recent initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium
        have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used
        productively within the context of industrial R&D.</p>

        <p>The debate on Open Data is still evolving. The best open government
        applications seek to empower citizens, to help small businesses, or
        to create value in some other positive, constructive way. Opening
        government data is only a way-point on the road to improving education,
        improving government, and building tools to solve other real world
        problems. While many arguments have been made categorically, the
        following discussion of arguments for and against open data highlights
        that these arguments often depend highly on the type of data and its
        potential uses.</p>

        <p>Arguments made on behalf of Open Data include the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>"Data belong to the human race". Typical examples are genomes, data
          on organisms, medical science, environmental data following the
          Aarhus Convention</li>
          <li>Public money was used to fund the work and so it should be
          universally available.</li>
          <li>It was created by or at a government institution (this is common
          in US National Laboratories and government agencies)</li>
          <li>Facts cannot legally be copyrighted.</li>
          <li>Sponsors of research do not get full value unless the resulting
          data are freely available.</li>
          <li>Restrictions on data re-use create an anticommons.</li>
          <li>Data are required for the smooth process of running communal
          human activities and are an important enabler of socio-economic
          development (health care, education, economic productivity).</li>
          <li>In scientific research, the rate of discovery is accelerated by
          better access to data.</li>
        </ul>

      title: 'Open Data: What is Open?'
      language: 'en'

      body: |
        <p>The full Open Definition provides a precise definition of what open
        data is. There are 2 important elements to openness:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Legal openness</strong>: you must be allowed to get the
          data legally, to build on it, and to share it. Legal openness is
          usually provided by applying an appropriate (open) license which
          allows for free access to and reuse of the data, or by placing data
          into the public domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical openness</strong>: there should be no
          technical barriers to using that data. For example, providing data as
          printouts on paper (or as tables in PDF documents) makes the
          information extremely difficult to work with. So the Open
          Definition has various requirements for “technical openness,” such as
          requiring that data be machine readable and available in bulk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are a few key aspects of open which the Open Definition
        explains in detail. Open Data is useable by anyone, regardless of who
        they are, where they are, or what they want to do with the data; there
        must be no restriction on who can use it, and commercial use is fine
        too.</p>
        <p>Open data must be available in bulk (so it’s easy to work with) and
        it should be available free of charge, or at least at no more than a
        reasonable reproduction cost. The information should be digital,
        preferably available by downloading through the internet, and easily
        processed by a computer too (otherwise users can’t fully exploit the
        power of data – that it can be combined together to create new
        insights).</p>
